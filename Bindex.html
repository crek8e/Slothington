<p>
The patriarch and the head of this great dynasty. Sir Solomon made his fortune in the bed industry, constructing high-quality mattresses and frames for thousands of sleepy customers. He harnessed his expertise in snoozing and lying about all day to become the most successful sloth-salesman of the 19th century. Sir Solomon defied all expectations that he would just have a sit down and have a little nap, and enjoyed phenomenal success. After his decorated career, he declared that his work was done and he was off to bed, where he stayed for the next 15 years of his retirement.

<p>
The wayward brother of the Slothington clan, Pirate Slothbeard, or Samuel Slothington as he was originally known. Legend has it, he left his landlubbing family to seek is fortune upon the seven seas. He travelled (at speed) across the waves, searching 	
for buried treasure of flowers and leaves and attacking enemy ships that got in his way. Old Slothbeard became a source of great shame for the upstanding Slothingtons, as they 
made their name in good society. He remained at large for many years until one fateful brawl off the coast of San Jose, where Old Slothbeard was fatally wounded. Legend says 
you can still hear his ghostly snores across the ocean...</p>
